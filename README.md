# Zompocalypse

Zompocalypse is a single or multi-player Zombie survival game which puts the Players in defense of Maze-town. Zombies navigate the maze for which the town is famed for in an effort to eat the juicy and nutritious brains of its inhabitants and it is up to you to stop them!

While you defend the town and traverse the maze you will find treasures and items which will help you in the defense of the town. Unfortunately, the residents are cheap, so you will still need to purchase supplies from them despite the desperation of their situation. See how long you can stop the flow of Zombies!

## Running the game

If you are running on Windows, you can simply double click the downloaded .jar file and the game will start up. Otherwise, navigate to the directory where you put the file and type into the command line:

`java -jar zompocalypse.jar`

To jump right into the game, just click the "Single Player" button and away you go! If you want to start up a Multiplayer game, one player will have to start running a Server. This is as easy as clicking on the "Multiplayer" button, entering in the details and then clicking "Start Server". Once you have started the Server, you should share your public IP address with all players who you want to join. You can find your public IP address here: http://checkip.amazonaws.com/

Once the players have your IP address, they can connect to the game by clicking "Multiplayer", going "Connect to Server" and then entering in the IP address. Once all the players have joined the game, it will start!

## Playing the game

You've just been dumped into the world of Zompocalypse. Be careful, hungry Zombies and Dragons roam the World and they will kill you if they get the chance. First things first, find yourself a weapon! Look around in chests and houses to arm yourself, and watch for hidden items. You will also want to get a torch so you can see them coming sooner. If you can't handle them on your own, start up a server and get some friends to help you.

Eventually, they will overwhelm you, but the longer you survive and the more you kill, the higher your score becomes. If you find the game too hard, enable godmode using F8 and you will be invulnerable against the Zombie's attacks.

## Controls

To move, you can use WASD, the arrow keys or the buttons on the right panel. To use objects or attack, you can press E, spacebar or click the Use button on the right panel. If you're standing on anything, you'll use that first, otherwise you will use or attack whatever is in front of you. The world can be rotated anticlockwise and clockwise with < and > respectively, or you can use the GUI arrows.

If you pick something up like a key and find yourself in front of locked door, you can unlock that door by opening up your Backpack with the Backpack button, selecting the key and then clicking the Use button within the Backpack view. Items can be dropped into a container from your backpack if there is one immediatly infront of your character, if not the item will be dropped at your characters feet.
