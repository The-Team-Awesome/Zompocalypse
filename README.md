# Zompocalypse

Zompocalypse is a single or multi-player Zombie survival game which puts the Players in defense of Maze-town. Zombies navigate the maze for which the town is famed for in an effort to eat the juicy and nutritious brains of its inhabitants and it is up to you to stop them!

While you defend the town and traverse the maze you will find treasures and items which will help you in the defense of the town. Unfortunately, the residents are cheap, so you will still need to purchase supplies from them despite the desperation of their situation. See how long you can stop the flow of Zombies!

## Running the game

If you are running on Windows, you can simply double click the downloaded .jar file and the game will start up. Otherwise, navigate to the directory where you put the file and type into the command line:

`java -jar zompocalypse.jar`

To jump right into the game, just click the "Single Player" button and away you go! If you want to start up a Multiplayer game, one player will have to start running a Server. This is as easy as clicking on the "Multiplayer" button, entering in the details and then clicking "Start Server". Once you have started the Server, you should share your public IP address with all players who you want to join. You can find your public IP address here: http://checkip.amazonaws.com/

Once the players have your IP address, they can connect to the game by clicking "Multiplayer", going "Connect to Server" and then entering in the IP address. Once all the players have joined the game, it will start!
